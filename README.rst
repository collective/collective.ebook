Overview
========

This add-on allows the formatting of a subtree of content as a
PDF-article.

It relies on an external program that transforms HTML into PDF (note
that the add-on was designed with `PrinceXML
<http://www.princexml.com/`_ in mind).

Note that currently, templates, labels, and descriptions are all in
Danish.


Compatibility
-------------

Plone 4.1+

While the default installation script should work in most cases, there
might be compatibility issues with some provided JavaScript libraries
– in particular, jQuery UI – if you've already got add-ons which need
to provide it, too.
